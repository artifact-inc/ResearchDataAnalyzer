# Quality Filter Configuration
#
# This configuration supports both recent papers (3-month lookback) and
# historical papers (1+ year lookback) by using age-adjusted citation thresholds.
#
# SOURCE-AWARE FILTERING:
# The quality filter is source-aware to accommodate different API capabilities:
#   - arXiv papers: Always accepted regardless of citation data
#     (arXiv API doesn't provide citation counts - architectural limitation)
#   - Semantic Scholar papers: Must meet citation thresholds
#     (Semantic Scholar API provides citation data)
#
# Usage:
#   - For recent papers (3 months): Use default settings - papers <1yr need only 3 citations
#   - For historical papers (1+ years): Use default settings - older papers need more citations
#   - For custom thresholds: Override citation_thresholds below

quality_filter:
  # Enable/disable quality filtering
  enabled: true

  # Absolute minimum citations (any age)
  # Papers below this are always rejected regardless of age
  # Note: Does NOT apply to arXiv papers (they're accepted without citation data)
  min_citations_absolute: 5

  # Age-adjusted citation thresholds
  # Format: "age_range_years": minimum_citations
  #
  # Default thresholds are designed to work for both recent and historical papers:
  # - 0-1 years: 3 citations (accommodates recent 3-month papers)
  # - 1-2 years: 10 citations (emerging validation)
  # - 2-5 years: 20 citations (established work)
  # - 5+ years: 30 citations (mature research)
  citation_thresholds:
    "0-1": 3
    "1-2": 10
    "2-5": 20
    "5+": 30

  # Minimum author publication count (not implemented in Phase 1)
  # Future: reject papers from authors with <3 total publications
  min_author_papers: 3

  # Allow papers with unknown citation counts (for non-arXiv sources)
  # arXiv papers are always accepted regardless of this setting (API limitation)
  # Set to true if you want to be permissive with missing data from other sources
  allow_unknown_citations: false

# Example Configurations for Different Use Cases:
#
# RECENT PAPERS MODE (3-month lookback):
# - Use default settings above
# - Papers published in last 3 months fall in 0-1yr category
# - Need only 3 citations to pass (reasonable for recent work)
#
# Example: Paper published 2 months ago with 4 citations
#   - Age: 0.16 years
#   - Threshold: 3 citations (0-1 year range)
#   - Status: PASS (4 >= 3)
#
# HISTORICAL PAPERS MODE (1+ year lookback):
# - Use default settings above
# - Older papers automatically require more citations
#
# Example: Paper published 3 years ago with 15 citations
#   - Age: 3.0 years
#   - Threshold: 20 citations (2-5 year range)
#   - Status: FAIL (15 < 20)
#
# CONSERVATIVE MODE (stricter filtering):
# citation_thresholds:
#   "0-1": 5
#   "1-2": 15
#   "2-5": 30
#   "5+": 50
#
# PERMISSIVE MODE (looser filtering for exploration):
# citation_thresholds:
#   "0-1": 1
#   "1-2": 5
#   "2-5": 10
#   "5+": 15
