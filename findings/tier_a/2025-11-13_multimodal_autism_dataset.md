## 💰 Business Opportunity

The integration of functional MRI (fMRI) and gut microbiome data for autism prediction represents an emerging research area with significant commercial potential. A comprehensive, high-quality dataset combining these modalities could enable the development of advanced diagnostic tools and support personalized treatment approaches for Autism Spectrum Disorder.

**Target Customers**: Potential customers for this dataset include medical research institutions, pharmaceutical companies, and technology firms developing AI-powered diagnostic and intervention solutions for autism spectrum disorder.
**Market Gap**: There is a growing demand for multimodal datasets that can enhance our understanding of complex neurological and gastrointestinal factors contributing to autism. Existing datasets often lack the integration of multiple data sources, limiting the development of more accurate and holistic predictive models.
