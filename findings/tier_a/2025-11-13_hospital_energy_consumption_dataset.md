## 💰 Business Opportunity

The paper describes a novel dataset on energy consumption in U.S. hospitals, which could be valuable for companies developing energy management solutions for the healthcare sector. This data could enable more accurate forecasting, optimization, and benchmarking of hospital energy usage, ultimately helping facilities reduce costs and environmental impact.

**Target Customers**: Energy management software providers, HVAC/building automation companies, and hospital facility managers seeking to improve energy efficiency across their operations.
**Market Gap**: Currently, there is limited publicly available data on hospital-specific energy consumption, making it difficult for vendors to train effective predictive models and develop targeted energy efficiency products. This dataset could fill that gap.
