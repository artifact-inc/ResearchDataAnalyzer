## 💰 Business Opportunity

The paper introduces Meta-MolNet, a cross-domain benchmark for predicting the pharmacological activity, toxicity, and pharmacokinetic properties of molecules. This dataset could be commercially valuable for drug discovery companies and academic researchers working on predictive models for molecular properties.

**Target Customers**: Pharmaceutical companies, biotech startups, academic research labs focused on computational drug discovery and molecular property prediction.
**Market Gap**: Existing models struggle with generalization to new molecular scaffolds, leading to fragile and uncertain predictions. There is a need for a standardized, high-quality benchmark to evaluate and improve the performance of these models.
