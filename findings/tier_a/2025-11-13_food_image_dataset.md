## 💰 Business Opportunity

The proposed food recognition framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets, indicating a commercially valuable opportunity to create a new food image dataset. This type of dataset could enable a wide range of applications in the growing health and wellness technology market, such as automated dietary tracking and personalized nutrition planning.

**Target Customers**: Companies and researchers working on food recognition, dietary management, and personalized nutrition technologies would be the primary customers for a new, high-quality food image dataset.
**Market Gap**: While existing food image datasets are available, this paper suggests that more diverse and challenging datasets are needed to address issues like background noise, varying capture conditions, and domain shifts. A new dataset that captures this real-world complexity could provide significant performance improvements for food recognition systems.
