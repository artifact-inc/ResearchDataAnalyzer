## 💰 Business Opportunity

The ability to infer high-resolution gene regulatory networks from single-cell multiome data has significant commercial potential. This data could enable precision medicine and advanced cell engineering applications across biotech, pharmaceuticals, and regenerative medicine.

**Target Customers**: Pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology firms, academic/government research institutions, and medical technology providers working on precision therapies, cell-based treatments, and computational biology.
**Market Gap**: There is a lack of comprehensive, standardized datasets of cell-specific gene regulatory networks derived from multimodal single-cell data. Existing data is often incomplete, siloed, or limited in scope.
