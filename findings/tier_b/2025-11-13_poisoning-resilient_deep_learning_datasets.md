## 💰 Business Opportunity

As deep learning becomes increasingly widespread, the risk of data poisoning attacks targeting these models also grows. This paper presents a novel technique to detect and sanitize poisoned data samples, which could be commercialized as a service for data providers and model developers to ensure the integrity of their training data.

**Target Customers**: Data curation platforms, AI model providers, and enterprises deploying mission-critical deep learning applications where data integrity is paramount.
**Market Gap**: Existing data validation methods have significant limitations, leaving an unmet need for robust and practical solutions to protect against data poisoning attacks.
