## 💰 Business Opportunity

Sleep disorders have a significant impact on health and quality of life, and accurate diagnosis is crucial. A high-quality dataset focused on classifying sleep disorders could enable the development of improved AI-powered diagnostic tools, which would be valuable for healthcare providers and medical device companies.

**Target Customers**: Healthcare providers, medical device companies, and AI/ML solution providers working on sleep disorder diagnosis and monitoring.
**Market Gap**: While the paper references an existing Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset, there may be opportunities to create a more comprehensive and high-quality dataset specifically focused on sleep disorder classification, with a broader range of features and validated annotations.
