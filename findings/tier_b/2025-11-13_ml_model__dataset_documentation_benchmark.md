## 💰 Business Opportunity

As machine learning (ML) models and datasets become increasingly critical to business operations, there is a growing need for comprehensive documentation and supply chain transparency. Creating a standardized benchmark dataset could enable organizations to assess the quality and compliance of their ML assets, identify risks, and make informed decisions.

**Target Customers**: Enterprise ML teams, data governance/compliance teams, and ML platform providers who need to ensure the quality and integrity of their ML supply chain.
**Market Gap**: There is currently no comprehensive, industry-accepted dataset that provides a realistic, representative sample of ML model and dataset documentation practices. This makes it challenging for organizations to evaluate their own practices or benchmark against peers.
